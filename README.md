# PrettyJSON

##### This is a javascript app I made to clean JSON and have it appear indented and properly formatted rather than have it giant blob of code on the screen. 
##### This is a very minimal app and I is made with 1 JQuery function. I did it this way because I thought it'd be the most efficient way to do it and shows that even a few lines of code can be useful and increase workflow.
