# PrettyJSON

##### This is a javascript app I made to clean JSON and have it appear indented and properly formatted rather than have it giant blob of code on the screen. This is a very minimal app and I is made with 1 JQuery function. I did it this way because I thought it'd be the most efficient way to do it and shows that even a few lines of code can be useful and increase workflow.

##### Rather than using Twitter Bootstrap I decided against it and used Tachyons.js. Tachyons is a small css library with helpfull CSS classes that help me speed up development. By using it I'm able to get projects working as fast as possible and apply classes where needed to help with the visual aspect without worrying about bootstrap classes.
